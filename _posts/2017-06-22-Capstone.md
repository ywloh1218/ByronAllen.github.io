title: Identifying Fraudulent Opiate Prescriptions

Between 2000 to 2015, over half a million people died from an opioid overdose, with the [annual overdose rates increasing every year](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html). Further, prescription opioids are known to be a [driving factor](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html) in this trend.

Here in Australia, opioid abuse has been increasing at alarming rates, with [oxycodone and fentanyl prescriptions increasing 22-fold and 46-fold](https://www.nps.org.au/australian-prescriber/articles/pharmaceutical-drug-misuse-in-australia) respectively.

Using a Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/apryor6/us-opiate-prescriptions), I was able to build a model to predict opiate prescriptions for prescribers in the United States.

On initial exploration of the data, I noticed a correlation between population size of each state with total number of opiate prescriptions and overdoses related to prescription opiates. This is to be expected, but the ratio of overdoses to the population was NOT correlated to population size. For example, West Virginia had 3.3 overdose deaths per 10,000 people, while New York had just above 1 death for every 10,000 people. This suggests that the factors related to opioid overdose differ by state.

I made the assumption that overdoses are related to fraudulent opiate prescription, and that states with higher instances of fraudulent prescriptions have a higher rate of overdoses. But how do I identify fraudulent prescriptions?

This leads to my second assumption, which is that LEGITIMATE opiate prescriptions do NOT occur in isolation. Instead, because opiates are painkillers, prescribers will prescribe an opiate for pain TOGETEHR with another medication to address the cause of the pain (For example, anti-inflammatory medication or other prescription medication). Therefore, prescription of non-opiate medications should be correlated to opiate medication.

The Kaggle dataset contains information on 25,000 prescribers and their prescription behaviour for 259 prescription medications (Including opioids and non-opioids). I tested several machine learning models, using the non-opioids as variables to predict opioid prescription.

The best-performing model by far was Linear Regression with a score of 79%. The other models I tested, decision tree regression and PCA, had an accuracy of 0.56% and -2.36 respectively. The high performance of linear regression is likely due to the linearity of the relationship of certain non-opioids to opioids.

Finally, for anomaly detection! I faced a challenge here as my dataset did not discern between innocent and fraudulent prescribers. I decided to manually test for outlier detection by comparing predicted opioid prescription from my linear regression model to the true opioid prescriptions, and identify the prescribers with the largest differences.

Because my model was trained across all disciplines on medicine, it's performance suffered when it came to niche specialties such as Addiction Medicine or Pain Management that, by nature, prescribe higher amounts of opiates and differ from the mainstream behaviour profile. However, the model still works well on more typical specialties, such as nursing.

*Figure 5: Top 5 largest errors between predicted and true opiate prescription for nurses in the dataset.*

As you can see from Figure 5, the average true opiate prescription for nurses in the country stands at 130 prescriptions, and the average error of my model is 70 prescriptions. These 5 individuals prescribed opiates over 10 times that of the national average, and the error is also many time the average. While there may be legitimate reasons for this behaviour (Perhaps this nurse works for a Pain Management specialist or clinic, and handles their prescriptions when the doctors are busy), I believe that they are definitely worth further investigation.

In conclusion, my capstone outlines a proof-of-concept approach to identifying fraudulent opiate prescription in America, using non-opiate prescriptions as predictive variables.
