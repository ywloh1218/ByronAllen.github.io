Between 2000 to 2015, over half a million people died from an opioid overdose, with the [annual overdose rates increasing every year](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html). Further, prescription opioids are known to be a [driving factor](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html) in this trend.

Here in Australia, opioid abuse has been increasing at alarming rates, with [oxycodone and fentanyl prescriptions increasing 22-fold and 46-fold](https://www.nps.org.au/australian-prescriber/articles/pharmaceutical-drug-misuse-in-australia) respectively.

Using a Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/apryor6/us-opiate-prescriptions), I was able to build a model to predict opiate prescriptions for prescribers in the United States.

On initial exploration of the data, I noticed a correlation between population size of each state with total number of opiate prescriptions and overdoses related to prescription opiates. This is to be expected, but the ratio of overdoses to the population was NOT correlated to population size. For example, West Virginia had 3.3 overdose deaths per 10,000 people, while New York had just above 1 death for every 10,000 people. This suggests that the factors related to opioid overdose differ by state.
