Between 2000 to 2015, over half a million people died from an opioid overdose, with the [annual overdose rates increasing every year](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html). Further, prescription opioids are known to be a [driving factor](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html) in this trend.

Here in Australia, opioid abuse has been increasing at alarming rates, with [oxycodone and fentanyl prescriptions increasing 22-fold and 46-fold](https://www.nps.org.au/australian-prescriber/articles/pharmaceutical-drug-misuse-in-australia) respectively.

Using a Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/apryor6/us-opiate-prescriptions), I was able to build a model to predict opiate prescriptions for prescribers in the United States.
