##### Yen Wei Loh, Data Scientist with Interest in Healthcare

I'm a data scientist who graduated from General Assembly's Data Science Immersive course in June 2017. Previously, I completed an Honours degree in Biomedical Engineering at The University of Sydney. Having come across data analysis techniques during my thesis in 2016, I became interested in the Data Science industry and it's applications, and decided to learn more about it by enrolling in the Data Science Immersive (DSI) at GA.

I am especially excited by the benefits machine learning and predictive analytics can bring to healthcare (Imagine being able to predict your susceptibility to disease based on lifestyle factors, and seeing that score go down as you change your lifestyle!), which is why I chose "Identifying Fraudulent Opiate Prescriptions" as my capstone project for the DSI course.
